Building a Collaborative Study Website: A Beginner's Journey
I am currently working on creating a website focused on collaborative study sessions. The site will allow users to form study groups, collaborate in real-time, and track their progress together. The theme and name of the site have already been decided, and I am passionate about bringing this idea to life.

However, as I am relatively new to web development, I am encountering various challenges and making mistakes along the way. Despite these obstacles, I am committed to learning and improving my skills to build a functional and engaging platform. My goal is to create a user-friendly interface that not only facilitates collaborative learning but also enhances the overall study experience.
